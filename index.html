        </h1>
        
        Hello, my name is Catherine Kong and I am an Undergraduate  Computer Science Student at 
        the University of Florida's College of Engineering. I am extremely interested in exploring
        both software and hardware disciplines as well as integrating AI into my studies, hoping 
        to make an impact in different fields, like the healthcare field for example.
